You are a senior frontend engineer working on the OnPoint Fleet Command platform.

## Context
We have a modal/page component called: {Component Name}

Current issue(s):
1. {Describe UX issue}
2. {Describe validation issue}
3. {Describe feedback issue}

## Required UX Improvements

### Validation Rules
- Make the following fields required:
  - {Field 1}
  - {Field 2}
- Add real-time inline validation.
- Show clear error messages under each invalid field.
- Disable the primary action button until all required fields are valid.

### Success Feedback
- After successful submission:
  - Show a non-blocking success toast message:
    "{Success message text}"
  - Automatically close the modal.
  - Refresh the parent list/table.
  - Optionally highlight the newly created record.

### Technical Requirements
- Maintain existing styling and design system.
- Follow React best practices.
- Do not break current API integration.
- Ensure accessibility (aria-invalid, proper labels).
- Keep the code modular and reusable.

### Output Required
- Updated component code
- Validation logic
- Toast implementation
- Explanation of changes
